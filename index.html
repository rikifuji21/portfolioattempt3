	<p>Hello! My name is Riki Fujimoto. As of now (2021) I am a Senior at Waipahu High School. Ever since I was little, I was surrounded by technology. This made me interested in how they work. I finally got into coding in junior year (I had been trying since freshman) when I was allowed to switch academies.</p>

	<h2>Goals</h2>
	<p>I want to become an electrical engineer, but more on the coding side, so that I would be able to code and make things. <br>If that doesn't work I want to try something else that uses coding, such as software development or something along those lines.</p>
